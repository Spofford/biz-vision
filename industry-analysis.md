Describing the Italian furniture market, it is worth mentioning its structural organization- industrial district clustering. The structural characteristic of the Italian wooden–furniture industry is a concentration of the manufactory in the industrial districts. The major concentration of which is spread in the North-East, which together with Lombardy, Toscana and Marche are the major regions of the national furniture manufacturers. This type of organization is formed by tight cooperation and presence of many small companies that are specialized in a particular furniture segment. That regional concentration of the industrial entities has enriched the specialization, labor work, high attention to design and know how thus stimulating the sophisticated internal demand.

This structure enables manufacturers to produce each piece with a great quality and high degree of differentiation, e greater process orientation due to very lean organization of small entities, thus providing a more incentives for innovations.

Italia has a thriving furniture industry, with upholstered furniture dominating. What is the secret sauce in product innovation? They produce so much that they export a lot of it, and have to differentiate to export markets. That export business is falling off due to decreases in exports of furniture at average to below average price point, so they have to specialize in high end stuff.

While much of the conversation in this article is around internationalization of products and parsing out consumer sentiment, it seems important to note that the same process could be said of crafting and selling furniture between US megaregions.

“I like to replace some of my furniture every few years,” only 35.1% of respondents agreed. Likewise, only 18.4% agreed that, “I change my furniture often to keep up with design trends.” Alternately, when asked, “I expect my furniture to last for many years,” a sizeable 95.1% of respondents agreed (which is up from 87.4% in 2008), with 53.2% strongly agreeing with this statement.

_The maker movement....WTF happened?_

In the U.S., 94 percent of all manufacturers have fewer than 100 employees.5  Now more than ever, the country’s manufacturing companies are smaller in size and number of employees, use higher-tech equipment and cater to more creative industries.

_The eulogies for the US Home Furnishing Manufacturing industry have been written. The once mighty sector has fallen to offshored production, Chinese dumping of products at less-than-cost prices, and the lack of talent to replace the aged workforce. Shuttered mills throughout the country left desolate towns and idled workers. University programs closed, shutting off the talent  pipeline for the remaining companies. A lamentable and tragic end to a storied industry? _

Perhaps, yet this is not the whole story. How has the industry’s cousin, office furnishings, thrived since the Great Recession, which was the death knell for home furniture? How can American-made furniture be an unmet consumer demand? The home furniture industry represents a classic example of a legacy industry so entrenched in its ways, that it succumbed to industrial Darwinism. According to those closest it, the Home Furniture sector represents a profound case of failure to adapt by not investing in technology, people, consumer research, or design & innovation.
*While office furnishing companies were investing in new technology during the 1990’s, home furnishing companies refused to adopt these efficiency strategies, choosing to compete solely on costs.
*Labor was considered to be only an expense line item. Repeated lay-offs, inhospitable work environments for women and people of color, and lack of worker career development has resulted in younger workers unwilling to consider manufacturing as a career option, further reinforced by their parents admonishments to avoid the industry that has caused so much pain to their families and towns.
*While the home furniture industry was railing against “young people who don’t want quality” and paying corporate lobbyists significant sums to fight Chinese dumping, they failed to recognize that consumer preferences had changed. Furniture companies continued to make what they had always made, selling it the same way they had for decades, despite the fact that consumers no longer wanted the same products and buying experience as their parents. What little consumer research was done, companies were not adapting their products or the shopping experience fast enough to capture the interest or dollars of consumers. Other countries with significant home furnishing industries have decades of consumer sentiment research. This is not the case for the United States.
*Focus on design is another critical limiting factor for the US home furnishing industry. As compared to its European counterparts, the US has not prioritized design, nor has it created the deep and dense networks of design and manufacturing._

_Yet, the home furnishings industry is not dead. The post-recession home furniture regions have retained their legacy strengths, though they are extremely consolidated, the workforce has been halved and value chains decimated. The remaining companies have stabilized, consolidated and, in some cases, expanded. Re-shoring and foreign direct investment in those legacy regions is evident, though not at the scale of other industries._

_*Many regions have retained their culture of handcrafted objects. Often found in the historical legacy manufacturing regions, these underleveraged assets are often linked to tourism, lead by non-profit organizations not known for entrepreneurial or scaling mindsets. Many of these organizations have “Border Blinders”- focusing solely on their operating region, rarely collaborating at a scope or scale to create the dynamics of market opportunity, and rarely linking to regional value chains. Yet, research has demonstrated that overall economic impact resembles “an invisible factory.” _

_*The Maker’s Movement has created a resurgence in the value of making things. Initially technology-focused, the movement has been criticised for lack of inclusion. This movement was not initially focused on entrepreneurial development efforts, but market development efforts are evident, in particular Makers Row, an aggregated marketing platform intended to connect designers and producer companies. Yet, there is little evidence of the heterarchical development required for larger systemic impacts. The movement is not specifically place-based, missing the opportunities for network dynamics required for reaching potential scale and scope of effort._

_*There is a nascent focus on role/potential of small-scale manufacturing for small city and neighborhood revitalization efforts. Economic development and place-based efforts are evident across the country.  _

_As with all sectors of manufacturing, furniture manufacturers are facing skilled labor shortages, too. An aging workforce has depleted the pool of skilled workers in the furniture industry — particularly upholsters and sewers. And fewer younger people are looking for those jobs.
The problem is that the industry is changing, but its image isn’t. Many subscribe to long-held beliefs that associate furniture manufacturing with layoffs, untrained manual labor, and dark and dusty work conditions. The reality is that the furniture industry, as in other manufacturing sectors, is introducing advanced technology into its processes, replacing traditional manual processes with sophisticated machines that operate in clean environments.
The challenge is how to attract and retain qualified labor and overturn negative perceptions of the industry, particularly among younger workers. The answer may lie in the reality that this problem is greater than the furniture manufacturing industry itself — the manufacturing industry in general is in need of a total image makeover.

“The furniture industry is in the process of transformation. The skills gap that exists is one of the big hurdles the industry must find a way to overcome. There is a need to communicate simultaneously with multiple audiences that are now active in the workforce and consumer populations, each with their own set of standards related to product and employment preferences. And, the industry must be willing to innovate and buck trends in order to thrive. Bold decisions made now will create course corrections that can send the furniture industry in the direction of increased profitability, competitiveness and market share for the foreseeable future.”_

_“Few industries face greater macro-challenges than furniture and no industry has done less to adopt the macro-innovations that are commonplace in other lines of trade. Let’s take a look at the structure of the industry and propose a way forward.”_

_The EPA and other government agencies used this era of high industry profits to demand investments that focused on safety and environmental 17 improvements. While their ambition may have been appropriate, the implementation of multiple waves of constantly changing rules led to huge inefficiencies and a waste of capital expenditures. More importantly, this regulatory capriciousness appears to have deterred companies from building new and more automated factories in the fear that they soon would need to be modified again.”_

_WRONG WRONG wrong

“Since lower costs will not be the answer, they must find a new strategy for growth in the increasingly global industry. This new firm strategy should focus around delivering the following benefits: (1) greater customization, (2) faster delivery times, (3) higher product quality, and (4) better customer service. A focus on automation and process innovation will be crucial to execute against these objectives without increasing cost. We have identified four potential strategies to enhance the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector of the cluster: (1) high-end / design-focused furniture, (2) customized upholstered furniture, and (3) low-end highly-automated furniture production, and (4) focus on contract/institutional and hospitality furniture, which are more time-sensitive. Strategies focused on high quality and customization follow from the cluster diamond analysis identifying the labor cost disadvantage and the favorable demand conditions in the cluster. “_

The rise of the internet enables us to see more clearly that knowledge drives wealth creation and that markets operate as a set of open networks embedded in other open networks. Economies are open networks of interactions that continuously transform and adjust.
