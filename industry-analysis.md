Describing the Italian furniture market, it is worth mentioning its structural organization- industrial district clustering. The structural characteristic of the Italian wooden–furniture industry is a concentration of the manufactory in the industrial districts. The major concentration of which is spread in the North-East, which together with Lombardy, Toscana and Marche are the major regions of the national furniture manufacturers. This type of organization is formed by tight cooperation and presence of many small companies that are specialized in a particular furniture segment. That regional concentration of the industrial entities has enriched the specialization, labor work, high attention to design and know how thus stimulating the sophisticated internal demand.

This structure enables manufacturers to produce each piece with a great quality and high degree of differentiation, e greater process orientation due to very lean organization of small entities, thus providing a more incentives for innovations.

Italia has a thriving furniture industry, with upholstered furniture dominating. What is the secret sauce in product innovation? They produce so much that they export a lot of it, and have to differentiate to export markets. That export business is falling off due to decreases in exports of furniture at average to below average price point, so they have to specialize in high end stuff.

While much of the conversation in this article is around internationalization of products and parsing out consumer sentiment, it seems important to note that the same process could be said of crafting and selling furniture between US megaregions.


_Scaled for production within megaregion. Sales outside megaregion considered an “export”. Capacity vs internal demand metric._

_Background on existing industry (nationally and megaregion breakdown), number of manufacturers and how much, export market vs. domestic, highest growth/sales regions_

“I like to replace some of my furniture every few years,” only 35.1% of respondents agreed. Likewise, only 18.4% agreed that, “I change my furniture often to keep up with design trends.” Alternately, when asked, “I expect my furniture to last for many years,” a sizeable 95.1% of respondents agreed (which is up from 87.4% in 2008), with 53.2% strongly agreeing with this statement.

_The maker movement....WTF happened?_

In the
U.S., 94 percent of all manufacturers have fewer
than 100 employees.5  Now more than ever, the
country’s manufacturing companies are smaller
in size and number of employees, use higher-tech
equipment and cater to more creative industries.
