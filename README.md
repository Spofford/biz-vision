# About this Document

Since its start, the leadership of Spofford Design sought to create a design-led organization, which we understand as a learning-led organization above all. Everyone involved in the Spofford seeks to both listen and teach (with equal passion). Documentation plays a crucial role in this generative give and take. We explore, we get lost a little, we discover questions we had never considered. But eventually, we all have to transform what the world has told us through a process of convergence, in which we synthesize and organize our thoughts, not only for our own benefit, but for the sake of communicating what we have discovered in our exploration.

This document encapsulates Spofford's vision for its future, touching on everything from how we'll make money, how we'll grow, and the impact we seek to have in the communities where we seek to work. Spoiler alert: while we will discover that our intuitions or assumptions were right quite a bit, we will also discover that we were wrong (probably a lot). So rather than craft a precious business plan that we intend on shopping around to investors, we've created a living document that we will update quarterly, documenting our most recent learning and slowly generating a narrative of the journey we have taken since we started. Version control through git makes this kind of iteration far easier, as we release new version quarterly while writing the new version in a separate branch. And our vision for the company, as well as the company's inner workings, policies, mistakes, and successes will remain public.

If you've come here with an interest in becoming a financial or advisory partner, welcome! You'll find we're great listeners, but also very particular about who we seek out to ask for assistance. You clearly have a special something that has led us to believe that we can't do this without you.

If you're a community partner, we're so glad to be able to share how we work with you. We're very proud of the fact that we are the kind of company that kind be completely open and transparent about who we are without any worry. We hope that this serves as the basis for the kind of trust-driven and authentic we'd like to have with you.

If you're a new employee of Spofford Design, remember that you don't only become part of a company by joining us, but part of a community that is far greater than the sum of its parts. Community and connection very often means a lot of risk and vulnerability. We know that can suck sometimes, which is why it's so important that we make ourselves vulnerable first, so that we're not asking you to do anything we won't submit to ourselves.

# About this Version
This is the inaugural version of Spofford's Business Plan and Vision Document. The training wheels are still on a bit as we figure out the best ways to communicate what we do, what we will do, and what we've done. We will release a new version of this document every quarter to demonstrate what we've learned in the past three months by editing and modifying the document to reflect the most recent thinking, experimental results, and additional information we'd like to include. If there's something missing that you'd like to learn more about, please email adam.h@spofforddesign.com.
