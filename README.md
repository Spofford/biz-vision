# About this Document

Since its start, the leadership of Spofford Design sought to create a design-led organization, which we understand as a learning-led organization above all. Everyone involved in the Spofford seeks to both listen and teach (with equal passion). Documentation plays a crucial role in this generative give and take. This document is Spofford's vision for its future and strategy for the present which we make public. This a living document that we update quarterly, documenting our most recent learning and slowly generating a narrative through iteration.

If you've come here with an interest in becoming a financial or advisory partner, welcome! You'll find we're great listeners, but also very particular about who we seek out to ask for assistance. You clearly have a special something that has led us to believe that we can't do this without you.

If you're a community partner, we're so glad to be able to share how we work with you. We're very proud of the fact that we are the kind of company that kind be completely open and transparent about who we are without any worry. We hope that this serves as the basis for the kind of trust-driven and authentic we'd like to have with you.

If you're a new employee of Spofford Design, remember that you don't only become part of a company by joining us, but part of a community that is far greater than the sum of its parts. Community and connection very often means a lot of risk and vulnerability. We know that can suck sometimes, which is why it's so important that we make ourselves vulnerable first, so that we're not asking you to do anything we won't submit to ourselves.

# About this Version (1.0)
This is the inaugural version of Spofford's Business Plan and Vision Document. The training wheels are still on a bit as we figure out the best ways to communicate what we do, what we will do, and what we've done. We will release a new version in April that describes the results of our experimentation and what we've learned by connecting with people. If there's something missing that you'd like to learn more about, please email adam.h@spofforddesign.com.
