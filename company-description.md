Spofford develops regional networks to change product discovery, development, and sales in the world of home furnishings. Consumers care more than ever about where the objects they buy have come from, who created them, and the environmental footprint they leave behind. Our focus is to provide these customers with a journey that is unique and deeply embedded in a sense of place and belonging. This regional connection can only occur through close partnerships with independent designers and the small to medium-sized manufacturers that have been the lifeblood of regional economies for generations. 

## *What we do*
* Develop digital tools to ease the interactions between manufacturers, designers, and consumers for the sake of collaborative product design, development, and discovery.
* Host a network of designers, manufacturers and consumers who want to play a role in the regional economies of the future.
* Provide physical spaces in which people can work, promote, browse, buy, and do cool things in cool spaces.
* Assist manufacturers, designers, and entrepreneurs with business development opportunities and build on opportunities we see in the market.
* Harness under-leveraged assets and revive them by reawakening regional sourcing, development, and manufacturing.

## *How we do it*
* Apply human-centered design principles in our work but creating connections first, and occupying the problem spaces that emerge from those connective networks.
* Promote human-centeredness in physical product discovery, development, and manufacture by minimizing or eliminating barriers to collaboration.
* Embed products within authentic experiences and narratives.
* Cultivate the language of design aesthetic of individual consumers, and blur the lines between those and the regional design languages in which they are situated.
* Provide essential constraints to product development and production processes to ensure sustainability, desirability, and a long view of materials use and consumption.
* Assist existing regional organizations focused on workforce development activities to ensure the viability and desirability of design and craft professions.
