_our hypothesis is that analysis from major brands is incorrect or incomplete, otherwise they would’ve responded to it, namely as it relates to feeling and experience of consumers. And that’s the experience or feeling of purchasing furniture and designing a home, and the assessment includes question not just on feeling and sentiment, but feeling of experience and that’s a major differentiator of this research. Not unsurprising that economists don’t understand that._

_After all, their sales are lagging, following a pattern that doesn't fit at all with the economy at large. Product differentiation but also experience_

_What is importance of brand? Story? Connection to people behind it? How much is that connection worth?_

When do consumers ditch Ikea?
The answer: at approximately the age of 34.

_A megaregion is a large network of metropolitan regions that share several or all of the following:
*Environmental systems and topography
*Infrastructure systems
*Economic linkages
*Settlement and land use patterns
*Culture and history_

_Population and economic projections suggest this unit represents the nation’s growth trajectory:  Between now and 2040-2050, more than half of the nation’s population growth and as much as two-thirds of its economic growth will occur in eight to eleven emerging megaregions. With economies rivaling many small countries, megaregions are becoming the new competitive units in the global economy, characterized by the increasing movement of goods, people and capital among their metropolitan regions. The shared environmental systems relates to Spofford Design’s focus on using local inputs, environmental sustainability and leveraging complement markets. Shared infrastructure relates directly to regional logistics and product flows. Economic linkages relate to industry value chains, consumer and labor markets. Settlement and land use patterns relate to current and projected housing development, and historical reference points. Culture and history are critical differentiators for product development and consumer preferences._

_There are currently four well-established delineations of US megaregions, though these delineations were developed using diverse methodologies, were developed with different end-use strategic intentions and were subjected to different points of criticism.

*America 2050
*Lang and Dhavale
*Richard Florida

_“The more an urban region is being shaped by the new economic dynamics, the more its spatial organization will involve agglomeration economies. These particular agglomeration economies are a function of the added management complexities for firms that disperse their economic activities under conditions of systemic integration, no matter the scale—regional, national, or global. The challenge for a megaregion is to incorporate economic both headquarter functions and those dispersed activities. In brief, megaregions should aim at maximizing the incorporation of diverse spatial logics.”_

_Identify concentrations in market on which to enter community development efforts (geospatial)_

_DECLARE what megaregions we are focusing on, how many, and why_

_But this should not obscure the fact that the value-adding potential of that region may well lie in the particular economic (and cultural) capabilities of the diverse urban and non-urban sites of that region. These types of particularities come to the fore in the evidence that diverse cities worldwide benefit from different types of advantages. There is no perfect global city. Global economic actors (but also cultural and political and civic actors) need many global cities, no matter how imperfect, rather than one perfect global city._
