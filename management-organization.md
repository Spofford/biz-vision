## *Structure and personnel*
A small, core team of partners will manage Spofford Design, which currently includes founder and CEO Adam Hasler and will grow as appropriate and as capable and committed potential partners emerge and need arises. Partners take responsibility for guiding vision, top level strategy, and identify the questions Spofford Design will provide resources to try and answer to whatever extent possible. Managers of Spofford Design use their expertise to work with partners designing projects, and will administer those projects. Associates generally join Spofford Design on a contract basis and work on a project-to-project basis. In addition, Spofford Design offers creative residencies, most notably our artist-in-residence who performs valuable services to the business and an upcoming design-residency in Spofford, New Hampshire. These residencies provide Spofford Design the opportunity to explore broader questions that may not have a clear business case (yet).

Spofford’s roots in design has fostered a belief that any endeavor improves as the diversity of participants in the conversation grows. It is also from experience that we know that finding and recruiting that diverse group of collaborators and co-creators requires significant additional effort to the conventional processes. Spofford will make that extra effort, looking in unconventional places for members of the organization and finding and recruiting partners, managers, and associates from varied backgrounds to ensure that our work doesn’t only reflect the experiences, emotional responses, and networks of a small subset of the general population.

Spofford Design, Inc. has already generated interest from potential investors, individuals with subject matter expertise in our market, regional economic development professionals, social enterprise experts, and potential customers representing each of our primary personae. We aim to form an advisory board of directors with a diverse set of voices to ensure we are on the right track and inform us of their predictions for our market. In addition, we will form a board of directors made up of seasoned investors capable of and willing to protect the interests of all of Spofford’s investors.
