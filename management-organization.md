Zingerman’s Community of Businesses (ZCoB) began as a delicatessen but then grew into a vertically integrated network of nine businesses that provide “great food, great service, and great finance.” Some of the businesses –Zingerman’s Bakehouse, Zingerman’s Creamery, Zingerman’s Coffee Company, and Zingerman’s Candy Manufactory -- provide food for Zingerman’s Delicatessen, Zingerman’s Mail Order, and Zingerman’s Roadhouse (a sit-down, full-service restaurant). ZingTrain, a training company, spreads the Zingerman’s model and a ninth company, called the Zingerman’s Service Network, provides each business with finance, IT, marketing, payroll, and human-resources services.
