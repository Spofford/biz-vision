 Thailand: customers visit stores to get new ideas about furniture before buying one

 _partnership with a tool like modsy_

 furniture is viewed as central to one’s self-concept; therefore, item selection is seen as a very important decision. Furniture is an emotional purchase for many people because it facilitates sharing and a sense of togetherness among friends and family in the home.

 Quality ranks as the most important evaluative criterion when furniture is being considered for purchase. In general, furniture made in the U.S.A. is a stronger criterion than environmentally-friendly furniture, but this is not the case for members of Generation Y. Brand and store loyalty are not experienced by most furniture consumers. They like to search for information and conduct research online, and are increasingly more willing to purchase furniture online (even more so over the past five years). Social media also play a role in searching for information about furniture. This is especially true for Generation Y. Fortunately, consumers appear confident in their decision-making skills and are not likely to experience buyer’s remorse after making a furniture purchase.

 Lackluster desire to spend more for made in the usa, environmentally friendly. Have to compete, at least close, on price.

 No brand loyalty _but maybe not cultivated_

 _Internet/social to get information about furniture, but they still need a place to go to give it a spin, plus a tool to help envision it in their house._

 _And while some of this survey data does ask about rooms (bedroom, living, kitchen, et al), there’s seems to be a disconnect between assessing furniture and taste for furniture and create a holistic feeling space, which seems like a huge part of the process and is a skill to be cultivated._

furniture purchases are considered important and are emotional in nature for many people. Manufacturers and retailers should keep this in mind – they are not making or selling a product, but instead are providing a way for consumers to spend time comfortably with family and friends. People are proud of the furniture in their homes and view it as an extension of who they are. This makes for a more engaged shopper, one who wants to understand as much as possible about his or her options before making a purchase. Furniture retailers should be prepared for customers to ask a lot of questions, having conducted research online prior to entering the store.

_Made in the USA seems dated and empty, almost right wing. Regionality feels liberal, like a CSA_

_What Starbuck’s did for espresso drinks still blows my mind as well. Educated consumers._

_Argument to be made that demand for infinite customizability comes from dehumanization felt by everyone. If I can have my product just as I want, that means I mean something?_

According to our verified hypothesis, personal information sources are observably higher rated on the Hungarian furniture market.

_I want Spofford magazine so bad. Content that feels authentic feels so critical._

Can’t actualize as a brand until physical/emotional connection to consumer. Physical catalog or magazine

Nothing can replace the feeling of discovery, interact with people we have a connection with

Discover in a serendipitous way, find something they didn’t expected. We’ll crave more of that.

availability of product, because that’s really become just a foregone conclusion — whatever I want I can get online. So there’s got to be an experience.

Are they engaging, are they unique, are they personalized, are they surprising or are they repeatable consistently? Most retailers aren’t hitting the mark consistently on any of those.

_Consumer preferences are influenced by place. In the world of homogeneous product offerings, competitive advantage can be garnered by focusing on the unique characteristics and assets of a region. US Home furnishings manufacturing assets are regionally-based. Developing a place-based strategy requires focusing on a geographical scale which encompasses a critical mass of customers, the requisite manufacturing capacities and available labor, along with the significant civic and cultural assets to support the effort. Taking a cue from the Asian and European adoption of large-scale regional development efforts to quickly scale industrial capacity,  build their economies, and  improve quality of life, Spofford Design will focus on US megaregions._


_Consumers: While the “What Matters to Metros” data is comprehensive, data layers related to
The presence of cultural signifiers can be of importance:
Buy Local campaigns, Farm to Table
Complement markets- Food, beer/wine/distilleries, outdoor activities  such as hiking/cycling/running along with manufacturers of gear. Indicative of disposable income, congruent values.
Craft organizations/festivals
Music scene (Live music venues, local/regional/national)
University presence
Historic and cultural places, events

Manufacturers
Small -scale manufacturing presence, support organizations, involvement with national readiness programs
Entrepreneur ecosystem development efforts
Placemaking revitalization
Community college programs, apprenticeship programs
Economic inclusion efforts/organizations (Disconnected youth, formerly incarcerated, others with barriers to employment, cooperative development efforts (municipality/organizations)

Designers
Proximity to design schools/programs
Number of designers in MSA (Density of designers indicates a density of opportunity- a key indicator)

_Megaregion maps can become the real-time feedback loops for marketing and sales information related to specific products, product lines, strategies and consumer data. These maps, over time, will yield the insights related to expansion triggers, whether that should be another SDPH and/or production expansion. Learning from the earlier phase patterns, early information about potential expansion locations can inform SDPH teams when and with whom early connections should be developed in the expansion location. This is particularly important for workforce development efforts, given that a critical limiting factor for expansion will be available talent. These data patterns will demonstrate what strategies are working, and provide guidance for which systems leverage points should be examined and assessed. Value chain data will be readily available. _

_The scalar impact of this data is of particular significance. With data from 3-7 initial megaregions and SDPH’s, and the intended extensive connectivity between and agency of these hubs, the rapid learning, prototyping and adaptation will contribute a great deal to the resilience and long-term sustainability of Spofford Design._

_INCLUDE DATA THAT WILL BE COLLECTED AND HOW USED_

_*Idea for scaling deeply at this stage: identifying needs within regions that are more capital intensive and need a more mature SD, e.g. financial products (student loans, insurance, commercial lending).
*Logistical automation
*”Child” business development that requires more capital and mature business, like investing in new coffeehouses, bars, other show room proxies, as well as opening new manufacturing interests where we have identified holes._
