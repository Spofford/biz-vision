## *In Brief*
* Significant emphasis on inbound marketing as a means of sharing and co-creating stories. Shows and videos, webinars, Pinterest-style taste cultivation, featurettes on network members all provide this narrative experience.
* Collection curation that reflects a deep sense of place, extending to culture, history, and materials.
* A tone of acknowledgment of the journey consumers are on and strong sense of empathy, and serving as the outfitter for the next step in that journey
* An invitation to become part of a society, where frustrations and ambitions are understood and creativity is nurtured.
* Today’s consumers research furniture buying decisions and plan interiors almost exclusively online, but they still desire a physical experience to make a purchase, even if they ultimately buy online as well.
* The purchasing experience falls far below consumer expectations
* Retail in general is transforming away from traditional showrooms to curated and serendipitous experiences

## *Consumers: What We Know*
Consumers want to be respected for their good taste. Additionally, furniture is viewed as central to one’s self-concept, and furniture is an emotional purchase for many people because of its role in sharing and a sense of togetherness among friends and family in the home. Importantly furniture and interior decoration usually occurs at times of great transitions (marriages, new children, downsizing). Spofford Design, on the other hand, takes the tone of the helpful mentor who has seen it all: we aren’t just a purveyor of furniture, but the outfitter of the life you hope to create for yourself.

This marketing strategy addresses very squarely some important data points in furniture purchasing in the United States and globally more generally (Nicole Ponder, “Consumer Attitudes and Buying Behavior for Home Furniture”, 2013):
* Consumers have very little brand loyalty
* They prefer higher quality objects but will pay only marginally more for it
* Similarly, they will tolerate only moderate price increases for “made in the USA” or eco-friendly claims
* Consumers rarely replace furniture with any regularity
* A wealth of information is expected to make a purchase
* The purchase experience matters tremendously

Spofford Design aims to address these marketing questions very directly and aggressively, seeking most of all to pursue brand loyalty by bringing them into a tribe who supports them, and to whom they can turn for help. REI stands out as a brand that has accomplished this successfully with outdoor equipment.

At the same time, some of the data points above speak to trends that go far beyond furniture alone, as younger consumers seek out greater serendipity and connection in their shopping experience. Spofford Design relishes the opportunity to allow consumers to learn while they buy, engaging them with stories, discovery, and feeling in a way that infinite choices at Amazon or Wayfair could never provide.

## *Marketing Strategy*
Spofford Design’s intention to use non-traditional spaces and configurations for featuring our products speaks to our unreserved intention to redefine retail. Spofford has begun to pursue partnerships with wine and beer experts and concessions operators to open spaces that serve the larger community as a coffeehouse or bar, but provide opportunities as well to try out floor models of furniture from local designers. Additionally, Spofford is pursuing the idea of renting apartments and furnishing them, and inviting potential buyers to visit and see how the furniture feels in a context similar to their own home, with a mix of heirloom furniture, high-quality and well-designed pieces, and even spaces for children’s toys and workspaces.

Spofford Design has a great deal still to discover. Beginning with a competitive matrix and continuing into a workshop to define our brand, Spofford Design is honing its own story, as well as the media best suited for the stories we wish to tell. From a research perspective, existing consumer sentiment research, especially in the furniture space, has some glaring holes. In response, Spofford Design has embarked on its own scholarly level consumer sentiment research. Among the hypotheses we wish to test are the degree to which place and culture influence consumer preference and the extent to which consumers feel comfortable designing their spaces, as we seek to educate a community of consumers with whom we are designing (rather than designing for them).
