 Thailand: customers visit stores to get new ideas about furniture before buying one

 _partnership with a tool like modsy_

 furniture is viewed as central to one’s self-concept; therefore, item selection is seen as a very important decision. Furniture is an emotional purchase for many people because it facilitates sharing and a sense of togetherness among friends and family in the home.

 Quality ranks as the most important evaluative criterion when furniture is being considered for purchase. In general, furniture made in the U.S.A. is a stronger criterion than environmentally-friendly furniture, but this is not the case for members of Generation Y. Brand and store loyalty are not experienced by most furniture consumers. They like to search for information and conduct research online, and are increasingly more willing to purchase furniture online (even more so over the past five years). Social media also play a role in searching for information about furniture. This is especially true for Generation Y. Fortunately, consumers appear confident in their decision-making skills and are not likely to experience buyer’s remorse after making a furniture purchase.

furniture purchases are considered important and are emotional in nature for many people. Manufacturers and retailers should keep this in mind – they are not making or selling a product, but instead are providing a way for consumers to spend time comfortably with family and friends. People are proud of the furniture in their homes and view it as an extension of who they are. This makes for a more engaged shopper, one who wants to understand as much as possible about his or her options before making a purchase. Furniture retailers should be prepared for customers to ask a lot of questions, having conducted research online prior to entering the store.

_Made in the USA seems dated and empty, almost right wing. Regionality feels liberal, like a CSA_

_What Starbuck’s did for espresso drinks still blows my mind as well. Educated consumers._

_Argument to be made that demand for infinite customizability comes from dehumanization felt by everyone. If I can have my product just as I want, that means I mean something?_

Are they engaging, are they unique, are they personalized, are they surprising or are they repeatable consistently? Most retailers aren’t hitting the mark consistently on any of those.
