Spofford makes and sells furniture. But beyond that, we serve as an outfitter for people whose lives are in transition and help to create great spaces and homes just as REI serves those in search of outdoor adventure. In the process we address the need to feel better connected to the people in their home and to the place where they live by taking a farm-to-table approach.

**Why will we succeed?** Spofford succeeds where other furniture and retail brands currently struggle by cultivating and serving as a steward of robust regional networks based on authenticity and trust. We operate within the bounds of design principles that favor inclusion, environmental sustainability, and empowerment. We provide at set of options in the market bookended by poorly-designed and cheap furniture on the one end and unaffordable, semi-custom designs on the other. Spofford provides access to regional collections comprised of great design at a high level of quality, at a price that’s actually within reach.

**So why home furnishings?** To start, we are passionate about furniture and interiors, and always have. It turns out, though, that in addition to providing us with the opportunity to pursue our passion of mine and build something awesome with our friends, home furnishings is a large, growing market with ample space and opportunity for shaking up a decrepit model that’s serving fewer and fewer people well. The total addressable market in the U.S. is projected to be around $115 billion in 2018, and growing at a rate of 3%. And with online sales already projected to to increase 11% in 2018 to $38.5 billion, new companies in this industry who are online from the outset have a huge advantage. But why stop there? Globally, the home furnishings market is estimated at $664 billion...and Spofford’s regional approach is just as appropriate abroad as it is here.

**But we need your help.** Spofford Design seeks advisory and financial partners to join us by offering expertise, insight, and essential capital (whether in the form of investment, grant awards, or loans). We currently offer convertible notes from $25,000 to $100,000, with a cap at $250,000. This financing will help us to learn more about the efficacy of our initial strategies and develop authentic and valuable connections within the regions where we will operate. A round of $1.4 million will follow to build new prototyping facilities in each region where we operate, and create the tools and services that valuable time spent with consumers, designers, and manufacturers has indicated is necessary and helpful.
