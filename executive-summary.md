Spofford Design is *the* mutual benefit network that delivers a new way of making things, and we will reinvent the market dynamics of regional home furniture manufacturing. Spofford connects the right people, builds the right products, and tells the right stories based on the belief that the history of American furniture manufacturing is still being written. But if we desire and expect different outcomes than those currently provided, and seek to take advantage of tools unavailable to the generations before us, we have to consider and experiment with new ways of organizing ourselves economically.

**So why furniture?** The way we build and buy furniture needs a serious overhaul. We treat home as a reflection of the self. From the newest acquisitions to heirloom pieces, the objects in our homes possess a special value and meaning rarely afforded to other things. Spofford Design believes consumer furniture is the most appropriate industry, and the industry with the greatest potential opportunity, to execute on our mission to build dynamic relationships between consumers, designers and manufacturers, thereby achieving a more meaningful experience with manufactured goods than has ever been seen before.

**Spofford Design’s has a simple business model: sell furniture.** We share in the profits of every piece developed and sold, the result of a process of true innovation. As a part of this, we’ve doubled down on the notion that place and belonging matter to people, and declaring clear design principles for 21st century products. By connecting these people through regional networks that align with this belief, we will provide unique value through physical, financial, and digital infrastructure, enough to merit membership dues and thus helpful recurring revenue. And as Spofford Design grows, we will fills the gaps in our regional networks with new businesses and facilities, and generate even more value and further opportunities to do things differently.

**But we need your help.** Spofford Design seeks advisory and financial partners to join us by offering expertise, insight, and essential capital (whether in the form of investment, grant awards, or loans). We currently offer convertible notes from $25,000 to $100,000, with a cap at $250,000. This financing will help us to learn more about the efficacy of our initial strategies and develop authentic and valuable connections within the regions where we will operate. A round of $1.4 million will follow to build new prototyping facilities in each region where we operate, and create the tools and services that valuable time spent with consumers, designers, and manufacturers has indicated is necessary and helpful.
