*Furniture Products*
Spofford Design’s convenes a supply chain to produce furniture according to a design we have commissioned, and sell that furniture directly to consumers. However, Spofford Design believes that the above model, adhered to by generations of furniture companies, is no longer sustainable relying on the current economic paradigm. As such, we offer a range of services and products to members of regional networks to empower collaboration between them to produce a new generation of furniture. Everyone who has contributed to development of a piece profits from the money made from that piece (See “Finances” for more on this). Access to the services for business and competency development, assistance, discounts, and early access takes a tiered approach not unlike software-as-a-service pricing patterns, offered to qualified candidates. Our furniture is distinguished by:
* A true democratization of design based on facilitated participation and consumer, designer, and manufacturer support, advocacy, and education.
* A process that results in far greater product innovation than what other brands hope to achieve through seemingly endless product customization. For furniture as with software, we arrive at the right choice through conversation, give-and-take, learning, iteration, and design expertise.
* Manufacturers provide valuable insights into material and cost constraints early on in the process.
* Adherence to a strict set of design principles to ensure environmental sustainability and cradle-to-cradle sensibilities, labor fairness and empowerment, and as broad consumer access to our products as we can provide.

*Experiences*
Prototype hubs in each megaregion figure prominently in the product and service suite Spofford Design intends to deploy, and fits well within a larger vision of physical spaces that confound traditional notions of the use of physical space for a manufacturing or retail interest. Coffeehouse or bar style concessions featuring regional food will accompany studio space and opportunities to experience the furniture. Simultaneously, revenue from concessions in addition to studio space memberships and event ticket sales should significantly offset the cost of operating these spaces. We foresee similar revenue generating spaces in major urban areas that serve as our primary markets for our furniture. Furnishing coffeehouses or bars with Spofford furniture, or even entire apartments available for rent for various purposes but available for visits by potential customers, are in our future.

*Services*
For consumers, Spofford Design envisions:
* Interior design lessons and tools
* Product financing
* Free Shipping
* Studio and factory visits
For designers, we can offer:
* Training in the human-centered process
* Access to legal and bookkeeping services
* Marketing assistance
* Design residencies to explore new materials and methods.
Services predicted for manufacturers include:
* Blockchain infrastructure for capital flows and contracts
* Logistical automation
* Labor force development and recruiting.
We intend to better understand how these various actors connect now through close observation in situ, and provide infrastructure, be it digital, financial, or physical, to strengthen these community bonds.

*Investment and Intellectual Property Assets*
It is important to note, especially given this characterization of Spofford Design as an entity that provides essential infrastructure to the community,  the potential role of Spofford Design as a purveyor of investment instruments and data. Within a very short period of time, Spofford Design will have a better sense than anyone in the world of points in the value chain that require entities within a region to go outside it in order to complete a task or procure a material. Spofford Design will have the unique position of knowing the best opportunities for investing in a region’s economy. We could have the option of doing it on our own, or partnering with an existing interest to either build a machine or train labor, and even proliferate alternative organizational models such as worker cooperatives.

The enormous amount of data that Spofford Design will inevitably collect will provide us with a highly desirable position. Analysis into this data will support efforts like those noted above. In addition, we will possess sufficient data to predict to a high degree of accuracy those objects most needed by our market. Providing designer partners with this information at the outset will ensure more and more frequent success in the market of our products.
