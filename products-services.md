maker-entrepreneurs are more likely to need assistance with advertising, legal support or connecting to other makers and local manufacturers.

_not design from top down, design that's emergent, from the bottom up and from discourse, within clear guardrails/constraints_

_DEMOCRATIZATION OF DESIGN. I think this understanding of what democratization means is wrong, and influenced by a Clay Shirky-esque here comes everybody. It’s a redefinition of design, towards human-centeredness (slow). Now we are in Adam country. Is this going to mean the two minutes at the mic for every tom, dick, and harry, or a facilitated process where everyone is understood and accounted for an included? After all, two minutes at the mic generally leads to the exclusion of the voices that aren't as loud. Also that the decision making closer to the ground._

What happens is you create a tyranny of choice. Going into a furniture showroom for many people, right off the top, is a miserable experience because they know that, first of all, I’ve got to find a style I like. Then I’ve got to go over and look at all these hundreds of fabric swatches, all of which are in different price groups, all of which have different options. And then I’ve got to choose whether I want to Scotch Guard it. I mean, there are a lot of choices to make.

Retailers that are just heaping more choices onto that equation are making a mistake. I think the opportunity is to find a way to assure customers you’re going to make that choice easier for them, that it’s not just we have more sofa styles than any other competitor. It’s that you can be in and out of our store faster and more stress-free having made the right choice if you come to us than if you go to our competitors because we have this really really cool way of selling furniture here that nobody else has.


_What interventions can we make in the lives of consumers to educate them and guide them toward better buyings decisions (have have local food advocates created a market for their products by offering regional and unique, but previously underappreciated or lost? How can we make consumers better designers, rather than just swallowing the out of the box taste served up by the big or fashionable brands?)_

_There is a degree of need for customizability (but not infinite! customizability, gave tasteful range and boundaries)_

_We can attain “cheap-eco” by utilizing cast off materials already within our regions, bringing price down because recycled materials and adding to the brand._

_Eco, well designed, sustainable, human are BASELINE. Not an advantage_

If governments really wanted to help kids succeed in the labor market, the best correlate with high pay is union membership. Teach kids how to collectively bargain and join a union in schools. If schools wanted kids to get good jobs, strong jobs, no matter where they end up, they would teach them how to stand up for themselves and others on the job market.
