## *Milestones*
Our vision of success hinges on the success of network members. Spofford Design seeks to pursue interventions that elevate the growth of its network members, and reaching core milestones will decide the success of these interventions relative to those touched by them.
* Curate, purchase, and warehouse new collections on a region-by-region basis
* Launch a modern, effective e-commerce site to merchandise products
* Fund residencies to push the boundaries of design and materials use
* Create physical experiences around our furniture in a unique setting
* 100% regionally sourced materials for original furniture
* Physical, public prototyping hubs in every region where we operate

## *Strategies*
We will start to cultivate consumer brand recognition and bring in revenue from an initial, curated collection made up of vintage goods, repurposed seconds market materials, and items already available for purchase from regional designers. These products will be available for purchase online, and consumers can test them at stand alone next generation retail locations (see “Marketing and Sales”), or at sites owned by partners willing to feature our products.

Meanwhile, Spofford will:
* Identify influential actors already operating within the megaregions. This effort will look and feel very much like a grassroots political effort, as we connect with organizations from the public sector, the nonprofit world, and private enterprise. Community creation strategies that have succeeded in other domains, and for us to the extent that we have tried them, are dinner parties, panels, meetups, free business development advice, and simply parties or barbecues to bring people together.
* Listen to ways that Spofford can ease frustrations for network members and partners. By using the process outlined above, we will prototype tools, processes, or services that target the aspects of operations with the highest impact and that we can address with the lowest effort.

As noted in the section "Markets and Economies", the networks Spofford will create exist within the bounds of geographical megaregions. It is with these assertions in mind that Spofford Design has chosen the regions that we call the American-Atlantic and the Great Lakes as the sites for its initial work. These regions were chosen because of the diversity of land use, the likelihood of future growth, the presence of existing manufacturing and a trained labor force, and the presence of cities sufficiently large enough to merit targeted marketing efforts. We have chosen to work in two regions in parallel, rather than one at a time, in order to understand the degree of difference between regions.

These network development efforts will ostensibly serve to unlock the knowledge flows between members. Spofford will build upon the above strategies within one year by opening physical spaces, which we call prototyping hubs, where network members can physically gather for the sake of co-creation and deepened a sense of place and belonging. The vision for these locations is three fold:
* Provide shared tools and workspaces for designers to experiment and explore designs with easy access to conversation with both consumers and manufacturers, both accelerating and reducing the cost of product research and development.
* Serve as an event space to host seminars and other meetings, or a “clubhouse”, for network members to learn and share, or for use by nearby physical communities for events.
* Act as a “third place” for individuals in the nearby physical communities to gather and enjoy refreshments of all kinds, thereby aligning us with the complementary market of farm-to-table food.
It is our hope that each one of these spaces, individually incorporated and managed, will receive funding from sources besides Spofford Design, and provide one of many opportunities that Spofford Design hopes to create to engage with the process of furniture creation and reimagine product discovery.

## *Methods*
A key strategy in our pursuit of understanding network requirements and frustrations is human-centered design. Human-centered design loosely coincides with the following steps:
* Empathy, which demands assessment, trust, and extensive interviewing with those the designer seeks to advocate for with a design intervention.
* Insights, in which the designer searches for patterns or deeper issues underlying the information gathered.
* Ideas, or unfettered imagining of possible solutions to frustrations identified or opportunities unrealized.
* Prototypes, or testable artifacts that can be iterated upon with the co-creators, and ultimately becoming a final idea.
* Validation, or the final assurance that a prototype satisfies standards for viability, feasibility, and desirability and can be released as a solution.

A key notion in the process, often ignored, is that most problems, especially problems as complex as those that occupy the social or economic realm, are never fully solvable. These wicked problems metamorphose, either on the margins, or peripherally into new problems, and so the designer restarts the process under the new conditions. In this sense, the designer never fully leaves a space delimited by problems, and cultivates a deep understanding of them and a strategy to continue learning about them. Strategic Doing, a framework devised by Ed Morrison at Purdue University for the purpose of regional economic development, has also influenced our thinking.
