Because the process is the sociological equivalent of basic research, most of the products it gives birth to represent a dramatic break from their predecessors. In this they differ from products that result when a company in effect outsources the R&D phase to a design studio like IDEO, which explores consumer needs by asking consumers directly what they want and by observing their behavior. In addition, products that are radically innovative allo Milano tend to have longer commercial lives than other goods; they create in consumers bolder expectations for the brand and high receptivity to their equally startling successors; and they tend to enjoy especially high margins, because they are so dissimilar to the offerings of competitors

_DESIGN CLUSTERS A LA MILANO_

What did distinguish the region was the number and strength of the links between these components and the quality of the interactions among them. In short, it needn’t be a lack of resources that keeps a cluster from forming. The factors that make Lombardy the envy of the other localities are imagination and motivation, which are within the capacities of any group of businesses, whether they be in Toledo, Ohio, or Ljubljana, Slovenia.

A basic starting point for my analysis is that a megaregion is a sufficiently internally diverse economic territory to contain diverse spatial logics –particularly, agglomeration and dispersal logics, which might translate into high-cost high density areas and low-cost low density areas. We know that large integrated firms need both types of areas for their operations. Thus the megaregional scale can enable the exploring of novel development strategies predicated on this diversity of spatial logics, hopefully to the advantage of both the more advanced and the least advanced areas within that megaregion. It would take innovative governance umbrellas and new types of privatepublic arrangement.

when major firms outsource jobs to low-cost areas across the world, they are outsourcing some of their tasks. Many advanced economic sectors combine sufficiently diverse tasks. Some of those have a preference for lower-cost areas while others, such as global city functions, prefer dense high-cost areas. Parallel to this effort to incorporate laggards, or less successful areas, into policy frames that today target mostly successful areas, is the effort to understand how cities in the middle range of urban hierarchies fit in today’s global intercity geographies.

_In order to connect closely with consumers, designers and manufacturers, Spofford Design
builds regional demand using a community-building approach, while also leveraging a region’s current manufacturing, cultural and civic assets to build new value chains, to provide more inclusive economic development, and to create sustainably sourced products._

_Working as community members, Spofford Design region leverages the linkages of economies, infrastructure, environmental systems, and common culture and history for its decentralized manufacturing strategy._

_Companies will have a smaller footprint, and will use more technology and fewer employees. Product offerings are specialized, often based on regional locality knowledge, materials, experience and culture. Company growth will be based on networks with nearby proximal urban areas. Companies will make a significant commitment to local/regional systems, developed by a sense of community collaboration and competition. These companies scale deeply within a region, building on assets, but inputs and products become more differentiated over time. Growth is predicated upon investment in people and economic inclusion. Providing opportunity for career development to the large populations not included in legacy industry can fill the talent gap left by an aging workforce. This patient development strategy requires close connections between private sector, education, public sector and support organizations. _

_Increased Motivation and Creativity
Decentralized manufacturing usually increases motivation and creativity, according to Harvard University. Second- or third-tiered managers are often given more power and decision-making responsibilities. This may spur those who are more entrepreneurial to use their talents to achieve results. These managers may take a sense of ownership into their operations, which can help increase efficiency among employees in both production and support positions. Highly motivated managers may also be more creative in solving problems and finding solutions._

_Flexibility
Small or large companies employing decentralized manufacturing strategies also enjoy greater flexibility. It is easier to communicate on a regional basis, for example, than through multiple channels at a corporate office. Decisions can be made more quickly. Production facilities also can distribute products to customers more quickly, as shipments have a shorter distance to travel. Teams may be given more authority to implement their own procedures for maximum efficiency. For example, a bottleneck may occur in one of the production stations. The manufacturing manager might decide to allocate an extra person to that station without having to get permission from the central office_

_More Detailed and Relevant Information
Information that decentralized companies receive is usually more detailed, up-to-date and relevant than those in centralized organizations. For one thing, companies using decentralized manufacturing are more in touch with local or regional consumers. Company marketers are better able to conduct marketing research surveys among their customer bases to determine what features, flavors,, styles and sizes they want._

_Spofford Design Prototype Hubs (SDPH). These hubs will be the brand network connector to the region and will serve as the key interface with:
*Customers
*Value chain suppliers
*Product/material innovation source points
*Other manufacturers
*Workforce development organizations
*Community colleges and Universities
*Nonprofit organizations
*Economic and community development organizations
*Civic and public sector leaders
*Craft organizations
*Industry associations/alliances
*Waste Management officials
*Complement market companies_

_SDPH could include manufacturing staff, designers, business development and marketers. While their role will continue to include product prototyping, the initial focus can combine initial production and direct training. _

_Megaregions are extremely large, encompassing many metropolitan regions and hundreds of square miles. Determining the SDPH site locations is not an exact science, and will require deliberate discernment. The different layers of data required will mirror Spofford Design’s focus on connecting consumers, manufacturers and designers. The location of the Prototype Hubs will based on close proximity to target market consumers, in a location with a design and makers ethos. These locations will be dynamic and growing, places Spofford Design team members would want to live._

Michael Porter....drew the attention of policymakers to the importance of clusters -- geographic concentrations of related businesses and support organizations -- as a key driver of regional prosperity.

Traditional Corporate strategic planning:
--thinking and doing separated. A small group of top managers define the strategic plan. Other lower in the organization execute it.
--linear and stable
--reliable for years into the future
--Based on analysis. Gather facts first

the strong economic performance of some "high technology" regions, such as silicon valley, boston's route 128, and research triangle park in north carolina, suggested that collaboration among universities, government and the private sector could successfully promote higher growth, high technology development.

_*Successful economic development requires broad-based support, and this support depends only partially on facts. Emotions -- how people feel about their future -- play an equally important role.
*Politics matter. If public money part of the plan, strategy depends on voters, business leaders may have ideas and money, but they rarely have enough votes. the process is as important, if not more so, than the final recommendations.
*The need for public consultation is ongoing throughout the process. Authentic engagement is not satisfied with an event, summit, etc. Support emerges gradually and disappears quickly. Not easily streamlined, taking shortcuts risky. Takes time to build consensus.
*top down from corporate does not translate to civic. Can't tell what to do._

The public is often invited to contribute ideas through forums, or more recently, a project website

When it comes to translating words on the page to action in the streets, the process tends to break down. The reason is simple. Consultants rarely have the deep local knowledge needed to guide implementation.

To forge consensus, regional leaders often draft vision statements that turn out ot be bland and confusing.

Regional development strategies are formed and executed in the "civic space" oustide the four walls of an one organizaation...the civic life of most regions involves complex interactions of organizations and personalities that defy simple description and quick analysis.

It is not always true that the best mousetrap wins, and markets do not necessarily settle on a single equilibrium point.

NASH equilibrium, no advantage to changing strategy, but knowledge changes equilibrium, hence any one market is predicated on efficiency of knowledge creation and transfer (discourse)

Because the competitive consequences of new knowledge are dynamic and uncertain, businesses compete differently. They look for new waves of increasing returns, and to do so, they collaborate to compete. In these markets, successful strategies value agility, flexibillity, speed, collaboration, and continuous learning.

clusters enable firms to leverage their assets and manage the risks of rapidly shifting markets. Embedded in a cluster, businesses can learn faster, spot opportunities faster and locate partners faster. They can be more competitive.

“In an age when everyone has instant access to infinite information, sense-­making––the ability to turn flows of information in real knowledge––has become today’s scarcest and most valuable resource and the key leverage point for value creation. The company’s primary source of wealth is therefore derived from its insights, knowledge, and ideas. Its success depends on how it leverages its intellectual capital.”

Four questions:
What could we do? - assets embedded in network
What should we do? - opportunity converted to shared outcome, measurable characteristics...our civic discussions that surround regional development are not very deep, disciplined, or focused. Our conventional civic conversations often represent a series of monologues, loosely strung together. Groups are not fully engaged in the deep thinking required to design compelling, shared outcomes. __To break this cycle, a disciplined conversation to design at least one shared outcome becomes a critical step in aligning a network with 'link and leverage' strategies.__
What will we do? -- who does what by when. transparent commitments. trust.
What's our 30/30? -- last 30 days, next 30 days. strategy is never done, acknolwedges constant process of learning and adjustment.
